# Day 5 (Mon)

## Opening Questions

1. Are there any questions about the Scala topics we covered so far?
1. What was the most important Scala feature that we covered during the last session?

## Review Homework

Write `nth` function that returns the character at `n`-th position.

    nth(s: String, n: Int): Char

Assume `n` as `0 <= n < s.length`.

## Placeholder Syntax

[Learning Scala](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-scala/9781449368814/) book, page 72

1. Function literals
    * Rocket operator `=>`
1. Demo: `doubler: Int => Int` function
1. Demo: `safeStringOp(s: String, f: String => String): String` to return the result of executing `f` on the input `s` string when `s != null`
1. Exercise: Write a higher-order function (similar to the above) that accepts three input arguments (`x` and `y` ints and a `f` function that accepts two ints to produce an int) that executes `f` on the two ints. How to execute it?

       def combination(x: Int, y: Int, f: (Int, Int) => Int): Int

1. Very useful for Scala Collections library (that's coming up next)

## Scala Collections Library

[Learning Scala](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-scala/9781449368814/) book, Chapter 6, page 83

Package: [scala.collections](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.13.8/scala/collection/index.html)

* [immutable](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.13.8/scala/collection/immutable/index.html)
* [mutable](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.13.8/scala/collection/mutable/index.html)

Data structures for collecting one or more values of a given type:

1. `Array`
1. `List`
1. `Map`
1. `Set`
1. _others_

Building block of modern software projects

[Iterable](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.13.8/scala/collection/Iterable.html) - the foundation for iteration and manipulation

**Demo**: Creating instances of `List`, `Set` and `Map`

**Exercise**: Review the scaladoc of `List`. Pick two higher-order methods (methods with a function argument). Write a sample code for each (to demo how they work).

**Exercise**: Create a `List` of `List`s.

`Nil` special "end" object

**Exercise**: Create a `List` of 5 numbers and find the ones that are less than 3.

**Exercise**: Create a `List` of strings and apply `toUpperCase` on each

1. Mapping List, p. 92
1. Reducing Lists, p. 93-94
1. List folding, p. 97
1. Converting Collections, p. 98
